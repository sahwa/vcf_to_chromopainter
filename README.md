# vcf_to_chromopainter

This is a basic tool which can be used to convert phased genotypes in vcf format into the format used by chromopainter. It requires a few libraries, which can be easily installed using ``install.packages(c("stringr", "data.table", "Rcpp", "optparse"))``. 

Tested on macOS Catalina, Ubuntu 20+ and CentOS 7.9.2009 (Core).
